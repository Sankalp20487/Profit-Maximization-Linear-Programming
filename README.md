# Profit Maximization Using Linear Programming

This project involves the application of linear programming to optimize the monthly net profit of a hardware company's new distribution center. The analysis focuses on determining the optimal inventory levels for four main products while adhering to budget and warehouse space constraints. The Excel Solver was utilized to achieve the optimal solution.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to maximize the monthly net profit of a hardware distribution center by optimizing inventory levels for four key products: Pressure Washers, Go-Karts, Generators, and Water Pumps. The project employs linear programming techniques to balance the constraints of budget, warehouse space, and product requirements.

## Project Structure

- **Excel File**: Contains the entire linear programming model, including the Solver setup, calculations, and sensitivity analysis.
  - **Sheet 1**: This sheet includes the objective function, decision variables, constraints, and the optimal solution generated by Solver.
  - **Sheet 2**: This sheet contains the sensitivity analysis report, which provides insights into how changes in constraints and coefficients might affect the optimal solution.

## Methodology

### Linear Programming Model
- **Objective Function**: Maximize the total monthly profit, formulated as:
  \[
  \text{Maximize } Z = 169.99X_1 + 359.99X_2 + 290.99X_3 + 142.99X_4
  \]
  where \(X_1\), \(X_2\), \(X_3\), and \(X_4\) represent the units of Pressure Washers, Go-Karts, Generators, and Water Pumps, respectively.

- **Constraints**:
  1. **Budget Limit**: \(330X_1 + 370X_2 + 410X_3 + 127X_4 \leq 170,000\)
  2. **Warehouse Space Limit**: \(25X_1 + 40X_2 + 25X_3 + 1.25X_4 \leq 12,300 \text{ square feet}\)
  3. **Inventory Requirement**: \(0.7X_1 + 0.7X_2 - 0.3X_3 - 0.3X_4 \geq 0\)
  4. **Sales Requirement**: \(X_3 - 2X_4 \geq 0\)
  5. **Non-Negativity**: \(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 \geq 0\)

### Solver Setup
- The Solver add-in in Excel was used to optimize the objective function under the given constraints. The solution provided the optimal number of units for each product to maximize profit.

## Using the Excel File

To explore the analysis and results:

1. **Open the Excel File**:
   Download and open the Excel file in any compatible spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel).

2. **Sheet 1 - Optimization Model**:
   - Review the setup of the linear programming model, including the objective function, constraints, and the optimal solution provided by Solver.

3. **Sheet 2 - Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Examine the sensitivity analysis report to understand how changes in constraints or coefficients may impact the optimal solution and profit.

## Conclusion

The linear programming model yielded an optimal solution that maximizes the company's monthly profit to $142,050.70. The analysis suggests that Pressure Washers should not be part of the current product mix unless their price increases. The sensitivity report indicates potential profit increases through budget or warehouse space expansion, making these areas of interest for strategic investment.
